The 2nd column and row represented SQQQ. Which is less correlation with the other 3. <br />
It's totally make a lot of sense! <br />
As SQQQ means short QQQ. It will go up while QQQ is going down and vice-versa. <br />
From the exmaple, it used the heatmap to show and visualize the differences and relationship.
